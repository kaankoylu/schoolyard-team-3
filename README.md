# Project Overview

This project is a web application that enables teachers and students to co-design greener schoolyards. It combines a structured design workflow with an accessible, game-like interface, allowing students of different ages to actively participate in shaping their future school environment.

The platform is delivered as a full frontend–backend system.

**Frontend**
A SvelteKit application that provides the main user interface for both teachers and students.

**Backend**
A Node/Express API responsible for managing sessions, templates, user roles, assets, and design submissions.

Together, these components form a working application rather than a conceptual prototype.

# Goal

The purpose of this tool is to support schools in creating greener, more engaging schoolyards by providing a structured, collaborative design environment. The system enables schools to:

* Upload or select the schoolyard map used for the design exercise
* Allow students to design yard layouts using drag-and-drop visual elements
* Collect, store, and manage student submissions
* Compare, evaluate, and combine designs for decision-making
* Provide structure and inspiration throughout the design process

The result is a digital platform that supports collaboration, creativity, and sustainability within education.

* Generate temporary classroom login codes
* Review, compare, and analyze submitted student designs
* Organize design competitions between groups
* Export insights and data for administrators or external stakeholders

## Student Functionality

* Simple, visual design interface
* Drag-and-drop components (plants, structures, play elements, etc.)
* Guided interactions suitable for younger students
* Optional introductory tutorial video
* Support for digital and physical workflows (e.g., Lego or paper prototypes)

## System-Level Features

# Target Users

* Teachers guiding schoolyard design projects
* Students (approximately 7–12 years old) contributing creative ideas
* School administrators reviewing aggregated and comparative insights

# Sprint Background

This project originated from a Design Sprint. The team performed:

* User research and interviews with teachers and students
* Competitive and inspirational analysis
* Concept sketching and solution exploration
* Prototyping using Figma and AI-assisted tools
* User testing with students, teachers, and a parent

User testing results averaged **7.95/10**, validating the concept and guiding improvements.

The current GitHub repository represents the implementation phase of the validated prototype.
